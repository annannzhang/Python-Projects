My name is Ann Zi'an Zhang, currently a student at University of Pennsylvania studying city planning and urban spatial analytics. I am interested in data-driven problem-solving, especially in urban context. 

Prior to Penn, I graduated from Wesleyan University in Connecticut, U.S., majoring in Art History, Psychology, and Science in Society Program. On my way to realize the "practical idealism" !
