## Welcome!

Here exhibits course assignments completed as a part of MUSA 550 Geospatial Data Science in Python. The website is made possible using Quarto. 

Quarto is a relatively new tool, but is becoming popular quickly. It's a successor 
to the Rmarkdown ecosystem that combines functionality into a single tool and also extends its computation power to other
languages. Most importantly for us, Quarto supports executing Python code, allowing us to convert Jupyter notebooks to HTML and share them online.
